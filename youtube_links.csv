From Wiki : Spirit, MER-A (Mars Exploration Rover -- A), is a robotic rover on Mars, active from 2004 to 2010. It was one of two rovers of NASA's ongoing Mars Exploration Rover Mission. It landed successfully on Mars at 04:35 Ground UTC on January 4, 2004, three weeks before its twin, Opportunity (MER-B), landed on the other side of the planet. Its name was chosen through a NASA-sponsored student essay competition. The rover became stuck in late 2009, and its last communication with Earth was sent on March 22, 2010.
The rover completed its planned 90-sol mission. Aided by cleaning events that resulted in higher power from its solar panels, Spirit went on to function effectively over twenty times longer than NASA planners expected following mission completion. Spirit also logged 7.73 km (4.8 mi) of driving instead of the planned 600 m (0.4 mi), allowing more extensive geological analysis of Martian rocks and planetary surface features. Initial scientific results from the first phase of the mission (the 90-sol prime mission) were published in a special issue of the journal Science.
On May 1, 2009 (5 years, 3 months, 27 Earth days after landing; 21.6 times the planned mission duration), Spirit became stuck in soft soil. This was not the first of the mission's ""embedding events"" and for the following eight months NASA carefully analyzed the situation, running Earth-based theoretical and practical simulations, and finally programming the rover to make extrication drives in an attempt to free itself. These efforts continued until January 26, 2010 when NASA officials announced that the rover was likely irrecoverably obstructed by its location in soft soil, though it continued to perform scientific research from its current location.
The rover continued in a stationary science platform role until communication with Spirit stopped on sol 2210 (March 22, 2010). JPL continued to attempt to regain contact until May 24, 2011, when NASA announced that efforts to communicate with the unresponsive rover had ended. A formal farewell was planned at NASA headquarters after the Memorial Day holiday and was televised on NASA TV.

But it is no illusion, the Pagoda is truly plated with gold!

The Burmese see this as the holiest Buddhist Pagoda in the world. 

The Shwedagon Pagoda is festooned with statues, carvings and decorations, central to Buddhism. 

To many, the important part is the Holy Relics of the past 4 Buddhas. 

But even for non-Buddhists, the sight is a scene of ornate and lavish beauty. 

Do not miss the sight of the golden jewels of the Shwedagon Pagoda illuminated at night.

[Album Introduction]

The 4th Album I Got a Boy

[English]
Girls'Generation Starts 2013 for the Music World!
The title song 'I Got a Boy' is an electronic dance song that mixes pop, retro, and urban genres. The addictive melody in the chorus is impressive, and the lyric doubles the fun of listening, which is mainly written based on the 'chatter' that girls have about everything every day. 
Especially, this new style of song was created for Girls'Generation by a dream team comprised of 'Dsign music', the a group of famous composers that composed the hit song, 'Genie', as well as the top composers of Europe including Will Simms and Sarah Lundback, and the composer representing Korea, Young-Jin Yoo, that it is expected to receive explosive responses around the world

[日本語]
少女時代、2013年歌謡界の砲門を開く！
タイトル曲の「I Got a Boy」はポップ、レトロ、アーバンジャンルの要素が混ざったエレクトロニックダンス曲。リフレーンの中毒性の強いメロディが印象的で、歌詞には「女たちのおしゃべり」をメインテーマに日常生活の中で女性たちが友達とおしゃべりする取るに足らない内容を面白く盛り込んで聞く面白みを一層倍加する。
特に、この曲は少女時代のヒット曲、「Genie」を作曲した有名作曲家チームの「Dsign music」や、Will Simms、Sarah Lundback等、ヨーロッパのトップクラスの作曲家たちはもちろん、韓国の代表作曲家である Young-Jin Yooも参加し、最高の作曲家ドリームチームが少女時代のために新しいスタイルの音楽を誕生させ、グローバル音楽ファンの爆発的な反応が予想される。

[中國語]
第四张正规专辑《I Got a Boy》1月1日正式发行！
主打歌《I Got a Boy》是融入流行、怀旧、城市等元素的电子舞曲，副歌部分中毒性非常强烈的旋律令人印象深刻。歌词以'女孩们的喋喋不休'为主题，以诙谐的手法叙述了在日常生活中与朋友们聊东聊西的内容。
尤其是创作《Genie》的知名作曲团队 'Dsign music'和Will Simms、Sarah Lundback 等欧洲顶尖作曲家以及韩国的 Young-Jun Yoo参与，可以说这首歌是由最顶尖的作曲家组成的梦幻团队，特地为少女时代打造的全新风格的歌曲，全球歌迷们的热烈响应值得期待。

[한국어]
소녀시대, 2013년 가요계 포문 연다!
타이틀 곡 'I Got a Boy'는 팝, 레트로, 어반 장르의 요소가 섞인 일렉트로닉 댄스 곡으로, 후렴구의 중독성 강한 멜로디가 인상적이며, 가사에는 '여자들의 수다'를 메인 테마로 일상생활 속에서 여자들이 친구들과 소소하게 나누는 수다 내용을 재미있게 담아 듣는 재미를 한층 배가시킨다. 
특히, 이 곡은 소녀시대 히트곡 '소원을 말해봐'를 작곡한 유명 작곡가팀 'Dsign music'과 Will Simms, Sarah Lundback 등 유럽의 최정상 작곡가들은 물론 한국 대표 작곡가 유영진도 함께 참여, 최고의 작곡가 드림팀이 소녀시대를 위해 새로운 스타일의 음악을 탄생시킨 만큼, 글로벌 음악 팬들의 폭발적인 호응이 예상된다.

Jeudi 25 juin 2009 : La plus grande star de tous les temps nous quittait

Il était l'homme de tous les superlatifs

Le plus doué, le plus mystérieux, le plus touchant, le plus génial, le plus fou, le plus généreux, le plus grand de tous les artistes.
Michal Jackson nous a quittés le jeudi 25 juin 2009, terrassé par un arrêt cardiaque.

Bon nombre d'entre nous aimaient Michael Jackson, les ventes d'album parlent pour lui. Lui, l'artiste recordman aux + de 750 millions d'albums vendus.
R.I.P Michael Jackson

""Billie Jean"" is a 1983 hit single from Michael Jackson's Thriller album. A number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100, the song was also the number-one R&B single for nine weeks in the United States and is one of Jackson's most critically acclaimed songs. It was voted best single of the year in The Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics' poll, and received two Grammy Awards in 1984 in the categories Best Male R&B Vocal Performance and Best New Rhythm & Blues Song.

LYRICS:

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and for forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice)

She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one...

Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover

---
If you've learned a lot about leadership and making a movement, then let's watch a movement happen, start to finish, in under 3 minutes, and dissect some lessons:

A leader needs the guts to stand alone and look ridiculous. But what he's doing is so simple, it's almost instructional. This is key. You must be easy to follow!

Now comes the first follower with a crucial role: he publicly shows everyone how to follow. Notice the leader embraces him as an equal, so it's not about the leader anymore - it's about them, plural. Notice he's calling to his friends to join in. It takes guts to be a first follower! You stand out and brave ridicule, yourself. Being a first follower is an under-appreciated form of leadership. The first follower transforms a lone nut into a leader. If the leader is the flint, the first follower is the spark that makes the fire.

The 2nd follower is a turning point: it's proof the first has done well. Now it's not a lone nut, and it's not two nuts. Three is a crowd and a crowd is news.

A movement must be public. Make sure outsiders see more than just the leader. Everyone needs to see the followers, because new followers emulate followers - not the leader.

Now here come 2 more, then 3 more. Now we've got momentum. This is the tipping point! Now we've got a movement!

As more people jump in, it's no longer risky. If they were on the fence before, there's no reason not to join now. They won't be ridiculed, they won't stand out, and they will be part of the in-crowd, if they hurry. Over the next minute you'll see the rest who prefer to be part of the crowd, because eventually they'd be ridiculed for not joining.

And ladies and gentlemen that is how a movement is made! Let's recap what we learned:

If you are a version of the shirtless dancing guy, all alone, remember the importance of nurturing your first few followers as equals, making everything clearly about the movement, not you.

Be public. Be easy to follow!

But the biggest lesson here - did you catch it?

Leadership is over-glorified.

Yes it started with the shirtless guy, and he'll get all the credit, but you saw what really happened:

It was the first follower that transformed a lone nut into a leader.

There is no movement without the first follower.

We're told we all need to be leaders, but that would be really ineffective.

The best way to make a movement, if you really care, is to courageously follow and show others how to follow.

When you find a lone nut doing something great, have the guts to be the first person to stand up and join in.

I adore creativity (Y)

Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end
Always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Somebody
I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody
I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
I used to know
That I used to know
I used to know
