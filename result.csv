This is different from English where most all the forms of most verbs are the same: I eat, you eat, we eat, they eat,etc. So in English we have to use the subject pronouns all of the time. But in Spanish, since each form is unique and reveals the subject, we don't have to use the subject pronouns. you may use a subject pronoun or even a name so it is clear whom you are speaking about..
